This is a Game that we attempted to make for our App Development class, because of our poor lifedecisions the one with the most game engine experience at the time was sadly only good with Godot causing a severe sanity drain debuff while working on this, furthermore only one person(me) could actually efficiently work on this making the sanity drain focused and him unable to recover. The resulting insanity has lead to him quitting energy drinks(which many theorized to be his blood) and to somehow break the halfway working game so far that it now cant even do the simple things it could once do and with that i gotta say FUCK. 

so my dearest apologies for being unable to complete this game demo

your totally sane Person :)
